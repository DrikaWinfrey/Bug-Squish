# Bug-Squish
This is a 2D graphics game I created to learn more about Object Oriented Programming using JavaScript. 

## Set-Up
1. Download the file
2. Set up a local server to run the code. (Simply clicking the html file will not work, it will only display a "Loading..." screen.
   - Open terminal
   - cd to file that contains the index.html file
   - run: 
        > python -m http.server
   - Now go to broswer (preferbly Chrome)
   - Type: localhost:port 
        > (example: localhost:8080)
   
 
## How to Play
Click on the bug to squish. For every kill, a point will be added to your score. You must be quick, each kill will speed up the animation. You only have 30 seconds!
